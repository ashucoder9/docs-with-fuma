## Introduction

This article describes how to run a node that tracks a Subnet. It requires building AvalancheGo, adding Virtual Machine binaries as plugins to your local data directory, and running AvalancheGo to track these binaries.

This tutorial specifically covers tracking a Subnet built with Avalanche's [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm), the default [Virtual Machine](/learn/virtual-machines) run by Subnets on Avalanche.

## Build AvalancheGo

It is recommended that you first complete [this comprehensive guide](/nodes/run-a-node/manually) which demonstrates how to build and run a basic Avalanche node. Below are the high level details.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="System Requirements">
*   CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
*   RAM: 16 GiB
*   Storage: 1 TiB SSD
*   OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12

Note that as network usage increases, hardware requirements may change.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="To build from source:">
1.  Install [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
    
2.  Install [go](https://go.dev/)
    
3.  Set the [$GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH)
    
4.  Create a directory in your `$GOPATH`
    
```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs
```

5.  Clone AvalancheGo

In the `$GOPATH`, clone [AvalancheGo](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego), the consensus engine and node implementation that is the core of the Avalanche Network.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego.git
```

6.  Run the Build Script

From the `avalanchego` directory, run the build script

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego
./scripts/build.sh

```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Manage the Subnet Binaries

After building AvalancheGo successfully,

### 1. Clone [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm)

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs
git clone https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm.git
```

### 2. Build the Binary and Save as a Plugin

In the Subnet-EVM directory, run the build script, and save it in the “plugins” folder of your `.avalanchego` data directory. Name the plugin after the `VMID` of the Subnet you wish to track. The `VMID` of the WAGMI Subnet is the value beginning with “srEX...”.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm
./scripts/build.sh ~/.avalanchego/plugins/srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Where can I find Subnet parameters like VMID?">
VMID, Subnet ID, ChainID, and all other parameters can be found in the "Chain Info" section of the Subnet Explorer.

*   [Avalanche Mainnet](https://subnets.avax.network/c-chain)
*   [Fuji Testnet](https://subnets-test.avax.network/wagmi)
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

### 3. Specify the Plugin with a Config.json

Create a file named `config.json` and add a `track-subnets` field that is populated with the `SubnetID` you wish to track. The `SubnetID` of the WAGMI Subnet is the value beginning with “28nr...”.

```
cd ~/.avalanchego
echo '{"track-subnets": "28nrH5T2BMvNrWecFcV3mfccjs6axM1TVyqe79MCv2Mhs8kxiY"}' > config.json
```

## Run the Node

Run AvalancheGo with the `—config-file` flag to start your node and ensure it tracks the Subnets included in the configuration file.

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego
./build/avalanchego --config-file ~/.avalanchego/config.json --network-id=fuji
```

Note: The above command includes the `--network-id=fuji` command because the WAGMI Subnet is deployed on Fuji Testnet.
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Run via the command line instead">
If you would prefer to track Subnets using a command line flag, you can instead use the `--track-subnets` flag.

For example:

```
./build/avalanchego --track-subnets 28nrH5T2BMvNrWecFcV3mfccjs6axM1TVyqe79MCv2Mhs8kxiY --network-id=fuji
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

You should now see terminal filled with logs and information to suggest the node is properly running and has began bootstrapping to the network.

## Bootstrapping and RPC Details

It may take a few hours for the node to fully [bootstrap](/nodes/run-a-node/manually#bootstrapping) to the Avalanche Primary Network and tracked Subnets.

When finished bootstrapping, the endpoint will be:

```
localhost:9650/ext/bc/<BlockchainID>/rpc
```

if run locally, or

```
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/<BlockchainID>/rpc
```

if run on a cloud provider. The “X”s should be replaced with the public IP of your EC2 instance.

For more information on the requests available at these endpoints, please see the [Subnet-EVM API Reference](/api-reference/subnet-evm-api) documentation.

Because each node is also tracking the Primary Network, those [RPC endpoints](/nodes/run-a-node/manually#rpc) are available as well.
