title: Introduction
description: Welcome to the Avalanche API Playground.
---

This is your one-stop destination to explore, interact with, and test the various APIs offered by Avalanche. Whether you are a developer building the next big thing on our platform or just curious about our capabilities, this playground provides you with the tools and resources you need.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are accessible via the following base URL: https://api.avax.network

Make sure to change this base URL according to your environment. For example, if you are testing locally, you would use http://localhost:9650.

## Making API Requests

To interact with the Avalanche Network APIs effectively, you need to specify the appropriate methods and the corresponding parameters for each request.

On the playground page, you'll find a user-friendly interface where you can input the desired method and enter the required parameters by adding new fields, if required.

This setup ensures that you can construct and send accurate API requests. Remember, each API endpoint may have different requirements, so refer to the API references for detailed information on the necessary parameters and expected responses.
